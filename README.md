## Interacting with the Canister

After deploying the canister, you can interact with it using the following commands:
`dfx canister call` or by integrating it into your front-end application.

### Example: Create new broilers bought
```
dfx canister call linkedIn createPost '{
    "age": 6;
    "numberOfBroilers": 4500;
    "breed": "Red"
    }'
```
### Example: Get all Broilers.
```
dfx canister call poultry_farming getAllBroilers
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.
